## Kanban games night

Karl Scotland and I will be running [a free games night at Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/the-ball-flow-game) on the evening of 7th March at SkilsMatter - London, UK.

Karl has kindly volunteered to run the games night before [his talk at QCon](http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/presentation/Kanban+System+Design) later in the week. Karl will be running the ball flow game to help us learn and experience kanban and system thinking concepts in a collaborative way. It will also be a lot of fun, as fun is an effective way to learn.

You should get a lot out of this evening whether your experienced practitioner or you are completely new to kanban, lean, system thinking and theory of constraints. The evening will be a welcoming and safe environment to everyone.

Rough plan for the evening:

6.00 pm An opportunity to networking, chat to people

6.30 pm Start to the evening proper: Introduction and games

8.00 pm Retire to the Hat and Feathers for further discussions (optional)

The hat and feathers is on the corner of Clerkenwell and Goswell road. You are free to join us there if you cant make the event.

  


Thank you
