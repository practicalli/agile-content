Here is a quick overview of the great technical events happening in London this week, 18th July 2011

**Monday (tonight)**  


Agile testing - a developers perspective.  A talk about agile testing at Atlassian (creators of JIRA, etc) from one of the graduate developers over from Sydney Australia.  Its a chance to ask questions about how agile testing affects what you do as a developer.

**Wednesday** & **Thursday**  
[![](images/lsug-logo.png)](http://skillsmatterblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/lsug-logo.png)On Wednesday, learn how to write good Scala (Idiomatic Scala) with the London Scala user group.  Kevin Wright has a huge amount of knowledge about development with the Scala language and if you wanted to learn how to write some good stuff in the language then this event is for you.  [LSug sign up](http://lsug.net/)

****On Thursday you can practice what you learnt at the Scala coding dojo at YouDevise.  Take all the advice and discussion from Wednesday and apply them in code.  At the dojo we spilt up into teams of 3-5 people, so everyone gets involved and is able to learn something.  No previous Scala experience is required, enthusiasm (and Google) are all that is needed.  [LSug sign up](http://lsug.net/)
