Agile fairytale is a neat way to express agile concepts in a way that is easily understood, using a context more likely to be meaningful or recognisable to a wide audience.

At the heart of Agile Fairytales are three fundamental concepts:

  * **Agile Values** - Agile Fairytales extends the [5 Agile values](http://www.selfishprogramming.com/2008/12/22/the-devils-in-the-detail/) of Communication, Simplicity, Courage, Feedback, Respect to include Trust and Transparency and applies them to real life

  

* **People** - Agile Fairytales is based on the belief that we can all change for the better
  

* **Continuous Improvement** - Agile Fairytales encourages us to improve one step at a time

## **A Creative Thinking Tool**

Agile Fairytales uses simple narratives to structure the way we look at problems. Each fairytale is designed to give us insights into our experiences through a better understanding of ourselves.   


###  When to Use Agile Fairytales 

Agile Fairytales are useful in the following situations:   


  * As an icebreaker

  

* When creating a new team
